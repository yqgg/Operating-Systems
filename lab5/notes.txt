1) Explain what happens when you run the program "threadSync.c"
and how it differs from the thread programs you used in Lab4.
    When I run the program threadSync.c its print statements
    show that the program prints a message before it enters the 
    critical region. Then, it sleeps for 1 second and then prints 
    another message.

    The threads in Lab4 demonstrate implicit sychronization through
    the division of work among the threads. In contrast, the threads
    in program threadSync.c demonstrate explicit synchronization using
    semaphores.
